# TTRPG Stats 
TTRPGStats is a plugin for obsidian that allows you create your character sheet in obsidian with dynamic components that allow you to track your hp, spellslots, gold and way more.

# How to use
You can create the components by creating a code block with the name of the component example:

 \```ttrpgstats-hp
